<H1> Traversing The United States </h1>
This project compares the functionalities and efficiencies of the following two graph implementations: matrix represenation vs an adjacency-list representation .

## Instructions to run the code
1. Open this repository into an IDE compatible with Python
2. Install the following libraries/packages
  - Flask
  - Folium
  - Pandas
  - Openpyxl
3. Run the code from the Main file

## Outline of functionalties
When you first run the program, you will be asked to select between the following two different graph implementations:
-  Adjacency Matrix
-  Adjacency List
The implementation chosen can have significant impacts on the programs runtime, which is why the execution time for each operation is displayed throughout the program.
